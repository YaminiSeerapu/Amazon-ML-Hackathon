# Amazon-ML-Hackathon
# Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Amazon ML Hackathon. The goal was to create a machine learning model capable of extracting entity values from images with high accuracy. The model was implemented using Python and OpenCV, achieving an impressive 90% accuracy under tight deadlines.
# Features
- Entity Extraction: Extracts values such as dimensions, weight, and other attributes from images.
- High Accuracy: Achieved 90% accuracy during testing and evaluation.
- Team Collaboration: Developed collaboratively by a team of three, with leadership ensuring efficient execution.
- Image Processing: Utilized OpenCV for preprocessing and feature extraction.

# Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- Machine Learning Techniques: Feature extraction, model training, and evaluation
  
# How to Run
- Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/entity-value-extraction.git

cd entity-value-extraction

- Install Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

- Prepare Dataset:- Place the images in the data/ directory.
- Ensure the dataset is labeled appropriately for training and testing.

- Train the Model:python train.py

- Test the Model:python predict.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg


# Code Structure
- train.py: Script for training the machine learning model.
- predict.py: Script for testing the model with new images.
- data/: Directory for storing datasets.
- utils.py: Helper functions for image preprocessing and feature extraction.

# Hackathon Highlights
- Team Collaboration: Worked with a team of three to deliver the project under tight deadlines.
- Leadership: Led the team to ensure efficient task allocation and timely completion.
- Accuracy: Achieved 90% accuracy in entity extraction.

# Future Scope
